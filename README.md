# Soundz

A project aiming at converting real time video into music.

Currently, only Xamarin.ios version is available. Saddly, the app is not listed on App Store, but still can be cloned into a mac and installed using a provisioning profile on any iPhone.

# Object recognition

The user can define sounds and link them to names of objects. Then, when the object is recognised by computer vision, this sound is played.
